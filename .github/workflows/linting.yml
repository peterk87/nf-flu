            ## Markdown linting is failing

            To keep the code consistent with lots of contributors, we run automated code consistency checks.
            To fix this CI test, please run:

            * Install `markdownlint-cli`
                * On Mac: `brew install markdownlint-cli`
                * Everything else: [Install `npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) then [install `markdownlint-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdownlint-cli) (`npm install -g markdownlint-cli`)
            * Fix the markdown errors
                * Automatically: `markdownlint . --config .github/markdownlint.yml --fix`
                * Manually resolve anything left from `markdownlint . --config .github/markdownlint.yml`

            Once you push these changes the test should pass, and you can hide this comment :+1:

            We highly recommend setting up markdownlint in your code editor so that this formatting is done automatically on save. Ask about it on Slack for help!

            Thanks again for your contribution!
